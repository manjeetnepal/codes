This is regarding a new script added to the template "Nepa Responsive Layout V2 Template - Quality Score (p770353783294)".
Just like we have a "GridMask(...)" function for a Single grid question, I have made a function for Multi Grid Question called GridMaskMulti(...) which returns the precodes of rows which have punch on specified columns.
In this function we have to pass an additional parameter that is a set of precodes of rows(questions) from the Multi Grid question.
Example : GridMaskMulti('Q20',nnset(1,5),3,5); OR GridMaskMulti('Q20',nset(6),3,5);
It is added in the Template mentioned above, please check and try it out and let me know if any feedback or suggestions.
